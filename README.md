# BLOCKCHAIN WORLD

---

**Blockchain** is a concept that has received a lot of attention in recent years as a result of the advent of two blockchain-based applications: **cryptocurrency** and **non-fungible token**Â (_NFT_).
However, these are only a few of the factors that contribute to the blockchain's growing popularity.

Blockchain's most common applications include:

- **Cryptocurrency**.
- **Bank**: Used to handle transactions in [Fiat](./Theory/Fiat.md) currencies such as USD and EUR.-> Faster money transfers and transaction verification via bank.
- **NFT - Non-fungible token**.
- **Smart Contract**
- **Supply chain monitoring**: It'll be easy to go back and check the supply chain if shipping data is stored on the blockchain.
- **Voting**: In principle, blockchain voting would allow everyone to cast ballots that could not be changed.

**_So what exactly is blockchain? What is its core nature? How does it work, how does it work?_**
